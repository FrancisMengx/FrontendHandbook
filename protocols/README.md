# Protocols
This section involves the concept of the protocols that a web developer
would need to have at least know and understand. This section will also
include the implementation/algorithm of the protocols.

This section will be divided into the most commonly used protocols, the
less common one for my daily development will be breifly covered in the
other protocol section.
