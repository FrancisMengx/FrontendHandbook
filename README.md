# Frontend Handbook

## Intro
When we talk about frontend development, people often think about HTML,
CSS, Javascript. However there are more than that, there are much more
than that. For example, http2/https, web performance, responsive deisgn
and development...

Learning frontend development can be frustrating due to the
nature of frontend technologies develops so fast. Something new is
coming up everyday, keep up is hard, and everytime you learn something
it feels like bits and pieces scattered all over the place, but in
everyday development, it is hard to grasp the correct piece from all those
bits and pieces. Everyone has that "I hear of this thing but forgot what
it's called..." moment during their development.

That's why I want to create this document that consolidate that all the
bits and pieces into one places, how deep I understand each bits and
pieces and keep track with what other technology and topics I want to learn.
