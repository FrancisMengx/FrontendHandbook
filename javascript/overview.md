#Javascript
Javascript is one of the most interesting programming language. A lot of
people have the "love and hate" relationships with the language. I
started learning and consider javascript as my main development language
about four years ago. Based on my personal experiences, self teaching a
language can end up missing pieces of important fundamental concepts of
a language. This section will cover some interesting details in
javascript that might be useful and may be missed when we are teaching
javascript ourselves.
